Upgrading hardware generation: Automated online swtching between hardware generations is possible if both hardware geneartions are available in the region where MI is provisioned.
This is a long running operation as a new managed instance will be provisioned in the backgroud and the database automatically transferred between the old and new instance with a quick failover at the end of the process. if both hardware generations are not supported in the same region, changing the hardware generation is possible but must be done manually. this requires you to provision a new insatnce in the region where the wanted hardware generation is available, and manually back up and restore data between the old and new instance.

So , based on DB sizes this can take longer, imagine that for the build a managed instance it takes 6 hours, so depending on the DBsizes you can calculate.
